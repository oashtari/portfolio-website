												<h3>Years 0-8</h3>
												<p>I worked at two different talent agencies, the first one for less than a year. I delivered mail, coffee, fruit, flowers, but eventually became a TV agent representing writers, directors, producers and other TV talent.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Years 8-11</h3>
												<p>Turns out, I didn't love being an agent, so I had the opportunity to become a digital agent as the world of YouTube stars was in its nascent stages. Still didn't love it, so then there was a year long "what's next" expedition.</p>
											</div>
											<!-- Break -->
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Years 11-14</h3>
												<p>I joined a social platform, fortuitously for me, they needed someone in LA to spearhead talent relationships. That turned into not just TV talent, but also sports, music and other entertainers.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Years 14-16</h3>
												<p>My curiosity had grown and working with talent was no longer of interest, but I was fortunate to get an opportunity to learn, tackle and scale business operations with the same group of colleagues, quite a learning period.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Years 16-20</h3>
												<p>Utilizing that operations knowledge, I joined a small start-up focusing all my time on bringing efficiency to the business and helping keep the doors open.</p>
